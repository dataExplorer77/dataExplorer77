### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Currently, I am enrolled in a Data Science Bootcamp at HyperionDev, where I'm learning Python programming, 
mathematical concepts, machine learning and problem-solving. Iâ€™m due to complete this course in March 2024.  

In addition to this, I'm also pursuing a Microsoft Power BI course where I am learning how to use Microsoft 
Excel to perform to prepare data, model and analyse and to create reports using Microsoft Power BI. I am 
due to complete this course in April 2024.  I will then sit the Microsoft PL-300 exam.

I also recently completed a Level 2 data course on Understanding Data Protection and Data Security course 
where I learnt about the current data protection legislation, organisational procedures concerning data 
and how to protect against data security breaches.
